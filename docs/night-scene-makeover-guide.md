### ðŸ“‹ Remaining Work

**Not Yet Implemented:**
- Step 7: Dev room habit (asset testing area)

**Visual Fine-Tuning Phase (Post-Refactor):**
While Steps 4, 5, 6, and 8 are technically complete and functional, all require manual aesthetic tuning through lil-gui:
- **Ground textures:** Tiling amount, normal map strength
- **Fog:** Density vs visibility balance, color matching
- **Shadows:** Bias values to eliminate artifacts
- **Flashlight:** Intensity, angle, penumbra for optimal gameplay

This fine-tuning will be addressed after the planned major refactor to modularize the codebase.

## Original Guide with Progress Markers

**Context**

- Collaboration style: **slow, methodical, one change at a time**. After each change the agent **MUST** pause, explain _why_, and ask for approval before moving on.
- The human (Michael) is a **beginner** and wants to learn. The agent must give plain-language explanations and short acceptance tests for each step.

---

## Agent Collaboration Protocol (read carefully)

1. **Summarize before doing.** Read this guide, then summarize the plan back to Michael and produce a small TODO list with checkboxes.
2. **One step per turn.** Implement **exactly one step**, then stop. Show the code as a **full, self-contained file** (not a diff).
3. **Explain the why.** Before code, explain the concept(s) introduced in that step in beginner terms.
4. **Call out manual actions.** If Michael must download a file or choose an asset, say so clearly and wait.
5. **Acceptance test.** Tell Michael _what to look for on screen_. Ask for approval before continuing.
6. **No cascade of changes.** Never jump to the next step without explicit "continue".
7. **Version awareness (r179).** Prefer up-to-date APIs; avoid outdated patterns.
8. **Rollback friendly.** If something looks worse, revert to the previous working state.

---

## Concepts in plain language (quick glossary)

- **IBL / environment map:** a panoramic image (usually HDR) that tells materials "what the world looks like" so they can reflect some of it. In three.js, assign it to `scene.environment` (as a PMREM texture).
- **HDRI:** a high-dynamic-range panorama used for IBL. Night HDRIs exist (stars, city glow, moonlight).
- **PMREM:** a filter that turns an HDRI into a format PBR shaders can sample efficiently.
- **Albedo (base color):** the true color of a surface. Too dark = no light to reflect.
- **Roughness/metalness:** sliders for how glossy/metallic a surface is. Stone: high roughness, zero metalness. Chrome: low roughness, full metalness.
- **Tone mapping & exposure:** the "camera response curve" and "ISO" of your virtual camera. ACES is filmic; exposure is your main brightness knob.
- **DirectionalLight:** like the sun or moonâ€”light rays are parallel; good for long shadows.
- **HemisphereLight:** simulates sky color from above and ground bounce from below.
- **AmbientLight:** flat fill that lifts all shadows equally (use sparingly).
- **Fog:** fades distant objects into a color; ties the ground to the horizon, hides the infinite plane.

## The plan (eight small steps)

You and the agent will move from "visible but wrong" â†’ "moody and playable."  
Each step includes: **(A) what you'll learn, (B) what you'll change, (C) acceptance test, (D) full code**.

---

### STEP 0 â€” Baseline snapshot + handy debug keys âœ…

**Implemented:** Commit `742e16a`  
**What we learned:** German keyboard needs Ã¼/Ã¤ instead of brackets  
**Current state:** Ã¼ increases exposure, Ã¤ decreases it

**A. Learn:** We'll add bracket keys `[` `]` to tweak exposure live.  
**B. Change:** Keep your current scene but add exposure hotkeys; confirm everything compiles.  
**C. Accept:** Press `]` â†’ scene gets brighter; `[` â†’ darker.

---

### STEP 1 â€” Clean baseline lights (no IBL yet) âœ…

**Implemented:** Commit `5131463`  
**What worked:** Removed RoomEnvironment successfully, much darker and atmospheric

**A. Learn:** With physically-correct lights (r179), intensities from old tutorials are misleading. We'll set a cool moon, soft sky bounce, tiny ambient.  
**B. Change:** Remove RoomEnvironment. Set: `moon=0.8`, `hemi=0.25`, `ambient=0.05`, exposure 1.0.  
**C. Accept:** Scene looks **night-ish but readable**; distinct shadow direction; not milky.

---

### STEP 2 â€” Add **night HDRI** IBL (manual asset + code) âœ…

**Implemented:** Commit `e2bfd91`  
**Key learning:** r179 bug - must set envMap directly on materials for intensity to work!  
**HDRIs downloaded:** 5 night environments (moonless_golf, satara variants, dikhololo, kloppenheim)  
**Current:** Using moonless_golf at 0.15 intensity

**A. Learn:** HDRI is a 360Â° image with brightness info. We PMREM it and set `scene.environment`. For r179 there is **no global environment intensity**; we'll set **`envMapIntensity` per material** (utility provided).  
**B. Manual:** Michael downloads one _night_ HDRI from **polyhaven.com â†’ HDRIs â†’ "night"** (e.g., _moonless_golf_2k.hdr_ or _starlit_skies_2k.hdr_). Place it at:  
`public/assets/hdri/night_2k.hdr`  
**C. Change:** Load via `RGBELoader`, PMREM it, set low intensity (~0.15).  
**D. Accept:** Shadows stay dark; surfaces in shade no longer go pitch-black; overall vibe stays night.

**Implementation notes:**

- Fixed r179 bug by setting material.envMap directly (not just scene.environment)
- Added +/- keys for live intensity adjustment (0.05 steps)
- Easy HDRI switching via HDRI_CHOICE variable

---

### STEP 3 â€” Add a **Dev Panel** (lil-gui) for live control âœ…

**Implemented:** Commit `716e148`
**What worked:** Full controls with double-click reset functionality

**A. Learn:** Live sliders keep you focused and curious, great for ADHD brains.
**B. Change:** Add lil-gui controls for exposure, light intensities, fog near/far, environment intensity, and HDRI selection.
**C. Accept:** You can nudge values while watching the scene; panel in top-right corner.

---

### STEP 4 â€” Ground **micro-detail** (color + normal map) âœ…

**Implemented:** Commits `466a52e` (1K textures) and `7a4056a` (upgraded to 2K) - 2025-09-05
**Current state:** Ground has grass color + normal maps with configurable tiling (default 64x)
**Note:** Values require fine-tuning for optimal visual balance

**A. Learn:** Flat colors read as plastic. A tiling **color map** + **normal map** gives grass "bite" under moonlight.
**B. Manual:** Download two seamless textures (e.g., **AmbientCG**: `Grass005_1K_Color.jpg`, `Grass005_1K_NormalGL.jpg`). Save to:
`public/assets/textures/grass_col.jpg`, `public/assets/textures/grass_nrm.jpg`
**C. Change:** Apply, tile 16Ã—, mark color map as sRGB.
**D. Accept:** The ground shows fine detail; close to camera it no longer looks like painted plywood.

---

### STEP 5 â€” Fog + sky polish âœ…

**Implemented:** Commit `6484727` - Comprehensive atmospheric fog system (2025-09-10)
**Current state:** FogExp2 with density 0.02, full GUI controls, altitude-based sky blending
**Note:** Values require fine-tuning for optimal visibility vs atmosphere balance

**A. Learn:** Fog binds the world to the horizon; your gradient can band if too low-res.
**B. Change:** Keep the taller 2048px gradient; tune fog to `near=30â€“40, far=85â€“95` and align color to horizon.
**C. Accept:** Distant objects soften toward the horizon; no harsh "cut line".

---

### STEP 6 â€” Shadow tuning âœ…

**Implemented:** Shadow system with full controls in place
**Current state:** mapSize=1024, bias=-0.001, normalBias=0.02, full GUI controls
**Note:** Values require fine-tuning for eliminating acne/peter-panning artifacts

**A. Learn:** Soft but defined moon shadows sell the mood. One shadow-casting light only.
**B. Change:** Keep `mapSize=1024` (or 2048 if GPU allows), bias in `[-0.0005, -0.002]`, `normalBiasâ‰ˆ0.02`. Fit shadow camera to the play area (Â±60 already good).
**C. Accept:** No acne or peter-panning; shadows neither razor-thin nor blotchy.

---

### STEP 7 â€” Start the **Dev Room** habit ðŸ“‹

**A. Learn:** A neutral testing pad accelerates all future asset work.  
**B. Change:** Add a tiny "drop zone" where the agent loads GLTFs from `/public/assets/devroom/` and lays them out on a grid with default **gray-blue PBR** if the model lacks textures.  
**C. Accept:** You can drop a model, see how it looks **under this exact night rig**, and tweak with the GUI.

---

### STEP 8 â€” Polish the **flashlight** âœ…

**Implemented:** Full SpotLight flashlight with F-key toggle and GUI controls
**Current state:** Intensity=50, angle=28Â°, penumbra=0.4, distance=45, warm color (0xfff2d0)
**Note:** Values require fine-tuning for better visibility/atmosphere balance

**A. Learn:** A spotlight attached to the camera. We'll keep it a **tool**, not a crutch.
**B. Change:** Toggle with `F`, warm color, narrow cone, soft penumbra.
**C. Accept:** When ON, bright cone with soft edges; when OFF, baseline scene stays playable.

---

## When to stop tuning (good baseline checklist)

- Without the flashlight, you can see silhouettes out to ~50â€“60 m.
- With the flashlight, details pop without bleaching the scene.
- Nothing feels "milky" (too bright IBL/exposure) or "inky" (no IBL/excess dark).
- Ground shows subtle texture; tombstones catch tiny speculars; shadows feel moon-cast.
- FPS is solid; no console errors.

---

## Appendix â€” Version notes (r152â†’r179, the bits that matter)

- **Color management tightened.** Use `renderer.outputColorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace;` and mark **color textures** as sRGB (`texture.colorSpace = THREE.SRGBColorSpace`). Don't mark normal/roughness/metalness/AO as sRGB.
- **Physically-correct lighting is default** (since r155). Intensities from old articles often feel off; trust your eyes, the GUI, and exposure.
- **Environment intensity:** there is no `scene.environmentIntensity` in r179. Control via **`envMapIntensity` on materials** or traverse the scene and set it globally with a helper function.
- **Tone mapping:** ACES is a good default; use **exposure** (0.8â€“1.4) as your main knob.

---

## Implementation Notes & Lessons Learned

### r179 Environment Map Bug

In Three.js r179, `envMapIntensity` only works when `material.envMap` is set directly. Just using `scene.environment` isn't enough. We had to:

1. Set `scene.environment` for diffuse IBL
2. Also set `material.envMap` on each material for intensity control
3. This was fixed in r181+

---

## What the agent should deliver each turn

1. **Explain the step in plain language** (2â€“5 sentences).
2. **List any manual actions** Michael must do (download/copy files) and wait.
3. **Show a full, working file** (e.g., `src/main.js`) that can be pasted in one go.
4. **Give a 10-second acceptance test** ("You should see X, Y, Z").
5. **Ask to continue or tweak.** Offer 2â€“3 tiny knobs to try.
6. **On issues**, propose a quick revert ("set exposure to 1.0; set env intensity to 0.0; does it help?").

---

## Final note

This is a lighting class disguised as a game. We're not "adding hacks"; we're **teaching the renderer what kind of night it is**: faint, cool sky; a single distant moon; tiny ambient bounce; materials with just enough micro-detail to catch that light. With the dev panel and dev room, you'll be able to audition any future asset in minutes.
