# Atmospheric Sky Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Current Status
**Progress**: 6/6 steps complete (100%)
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-13
**Latest Completed**: Horror Atmosphere Tuning
**All Steps Complete**: Atmospheric sky implementation fully finished
**Next Priority**: Ready for other development phases

## 🎯 Goal
Transform the current simple 2-color gradient sky into a realistic, atmospheric night sky that enhances the horror game atmosphere while maintaining performance.

## 📚 Background Research Summary

### Why Current Sky Looks Wrong
- **Too simple**: 2-color gradient lacks the complexity of real night skies
- **Pure blacks**: Creates "void" feeling rather than atmosphere
- **No variation**: Missing the subtle noise and variations of real atmosphere
- **Color banding**: Smooth gradients create visible bands on 8-bit displays
- **Missing stars**: No reference points make darkness feel flat

### What Makes Night Skies Realistic
1. **Multi-stop gradients**: Real skies have 3-4 distinct zones
2. **Light pollution**: Creates warm glow at horizon (never pure black)
3. **Atmospheric scattering**: Causes subtle blue-grey tones even in darkness
4. **Noise variation**: Subtle variations prevent flat appearance
5. **Stars with falloff**: Brightest at zenith, fade near horizon

## 🎨 Target Color Palette

Based on research for rural cemetery (200-250m from village):

```javascript
// 4-stop gradient from horizon to zenith
Horizon:     #2B1E1B  // Warm grey-brown (sodium lamp pollution)
Mid-Low:     #15131C  // Dark plum (transition zone)
Mid-High:    #0D1019  // Deep grey-blue (main sky)
Zenith:      #060B14  // Very dark indigo (darkest but NOT black)
```

## 🏗️ Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Four-Stop Gradient Shader ✅ [2025-09-07]
**Status**: COMPLETE - Implemented with full GUI integration  
**What**: Upgrade from 2-color to 4-color gradient with smooth transitions  
**Why**: Real skies have multiple transition zones, not just top/bottom  
**How**: Add two middle color uniforms and use smoothstep for blending  

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Created custom GLSL vertex/fragment shaders  
- Fixed critical bug: gradient now calculated from camera position, not world origin  
- Used eye-ray calculation for proper horizon alignment  
- Full GUI controls for all 4 colors + transition positions  
- Smooth transitions using smoothstep function  

**Known Issues**:  
- Colors are functional but too subtle - needs tuning for better visibility  
- Considered acceptable for initial implementation  

**Testing Results**:  
✅ Complex gradient with 4 distinct zones  
✅ Proper horizon alignment  
✅ GUI controls responsive  
✅ No z-fighting or rendering issues

### Step 2: Light Pollution Radial Glow ✅ [2025-09-08]
**Status**: COMPLETE - Implemented dual-source light pollution system  
**What**: Add directional glow simulating village lights  
**Why**: Rural areas have subtle light domes from nearby settlements  
**How**: Calculate angle to village, apply radial falloff with noise  

**Implementation Notes**:  
- Upgraded from single-source to **dual-source system** for enhanced realism  
- **Near village** (NW, 250m): Noticeable orange glow with physics-based falloff  
- **Distant village** (SE, 2km): Subtle background glow with altitude fade  
- Full GUI controls for both light pollution sources  
- Physics-based intensity calculation with atmospheric scattering simulation  

**Concepts for Beginners**:
- **Radial falloff**: Light gets weaker with distance (inverse square law)
- **Altitude fade**: Light pollution fades as you look higher in the sky
- **Directional glow**: Stronger in direction of light source
- **Dual-source system**: Multiple light sources create more realistic sky variation

**Fine-tuning Update** [2025-09-08]:  
Based on real-world testing, adjusted default values for more realistic appearance:
- **Near village**: Wider spread (90° vs 70°), higher reach (40% vs 30% altitude)
- **Distant village**: More visible but subtle (0.1 vs 0.08 intensity, 50° vs 40° spread)  
- **Extended GUI ranges**: Spread now adjustable from 30-120° for better control
- Result: More natural light pollution that better matches rural cemetery lighting

**Testing Results**:  
✅ Near village creates noticeable but not overpowering glow  
✅ Distant village provides subtle atmospheric enhancement  
✅ Both sources have independent controls  
✅ Physics-based falloff feels natural  
✅ No performance impact on 60 FPS target
✅ Fine-tuned values provide more realistic appearance

### Step 3: Dithering (Anti-Banding) ✅ [2025-09-08]
**Status**: COMPLETE - Implemented ordered dithering with hash-based screen-space noise
**What**: Add ordered dithering to prevent color banding
**Why**: Subtle gradients create visible bands on 8-bit monitors
**How**: Add tiny noise pattern that breaks up smooth transitions

**Implementation Notes**:
- Hash-based screen-space noise function for consistent, ordered pattern
- Default strength: 0.008 (effective but subtle)
- Acts like "anti-aliasing for gradients"
- Full GUI control with fine adjustment range (0.0-0.02)
- Minimal performance impact - single hash calculation per pixel

**Concepts for Beginners**:
- **Color banding**: Visible steps in gradients due to limited colors
- **Dithering**: Pattern of dots that tricks eye into seeing smooth gradients
- **Ordered dithering**: Predictable pattern that's less noisy than random
- **Hash function**: Mathematical way to create pseudo-random patterns from screen position
- **Screen-space noise**: Pattern based on pixel position, not world coordinates

**Testing Results**:
✅ Eliminates visible color bands in 4-stop gradient sky
✅ Subtle grain effect that enhances rather than distracts
✅ GUI controls allow fine-tuning for different displays
✅ No performance impact on 60 FPS target
✅ Works consistently across all viewing angles
