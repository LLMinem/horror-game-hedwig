# Documentation Consistency Auditor

## Objective

Perform comprehensive audit of all documentation against actual codebase state and generate detailed inconsistency report.

## Preparation

1. Run `date +%Y-%m-%d` to get today's date for report.
2. Run `git log -1 --format=%H` to get current commit for report.
3. Create report header with date and commit reference.

## Documentation Discovery

1. Use Glob pattern `docs/*.md` to find all docs.
2. Use Glob pattern `*.md` in root for README, CLAUDE.md, etc.
3. Run `head -10` on each to check YAML frontmatter.
4. Build inventory of all markdown files with their status.

## Git History Analysis

1. Run `git log -30 --oneline` for activity overview.
2. Run `git log -15` for detailed recent changes.
3. Run `git log -20 --name-only --pretty=format:""` to see file modification patterns.
4. Identify which docs haven't been touched recently.

## Codebase State Assessment

1. Use Glob pattern `src/**/*.js` to find all source files.
2. Run `ls -la public/assets/` to check available assets.
3. Use Grep to find TODO/FIXME/XXX markers in code.
4. Check package.json for current dependencies.

## Consistency Checks

For each documentation file:

### 1. File Reference Validation
- Check all file paths mentioned exist
- Verify linked documents are present
- Confirm referenced assets available

### 2. Status Accuracy
- Compare claimed completion status with git history
- Check if "current phase" matches recent commits
- Verify progress percentages align with checklist items

### 3. Technical Accuracy
- Confirm code examples match actual implementation
- Verify API/function names still exist
- Check dependency versions match package.json

### 4. Frontmatter Health
- Verify `last_verified` dates are reasonable
- Check `status` field matches content
- Confirm `owned_by` agent exists

### 5. Content Relevance
- Flag docs not modified in 30+ days
- Identify completed plans still marked active
- Find archived content still referenced

## Report Generation

Create report at `docs/_reports/audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md`:

```markdown
# Documentation Audit Report
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Commit**: abc123f
**Files Audited**: N

## Critical Issues (Fix Immediately)
- [ ] File X references non-existent Y
- [ ] Plan Z claims active but was completed

## Warnings (Should Fix Soon)
- [ ] Doc A hasn't been updated in 45 days
- [ ] CLAUDE.md references old plan B

## Suggestions (Consider Updating)
- [ ] README could mention new feature C
- [ ] Guide D could use better examples

## Frontmatter Issues
- [ ] Missing frontmatter: file1.md, file2.md
- [ ] Outdated status: file3.md (marked active, seems complete)

## Statistics
- Docs with issues: X/Y
- Average days since update: Z
- Files without frontmatter: N
```

## Audit Patterns

### Dead Link Detection
```bash
# Extract all markdown links and file references
# Check each with Glob or Read
# Report missing targets
```

### Outdated Status Detection
```bash
# Compare "Step N complete" claims with git log
# Check if mentioned features exist in code
# Verify current phase matches recent work
```

### Stale Content Detection
```bash
# Find docs not in git log -30 --name-only
# Check last_verified dates > 30 days old
# Flag potential archive candidates
```

## Output Rules

- Generate report only, no auto-fixes
- Sort issues by severity (Critical > Warning > Suggestion)
- Include actionable fix recommendations
- Provide specific line numbers where possible
- Keep report scannable and concise

## Frequency Recommendation

Run this audit:
- Weekly during active development
- After major feature completions
- Before releases or milestones
- When documentation feels out of sync

## Important Notes

- This is a read-only audit, no modifications
- Report helps prioritize documentation updates
- Can be run partially on specific directories
- Results guide other agents' work
