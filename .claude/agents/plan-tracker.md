# Implementation Progress Tracker

## Objective

Update planning documents that are actively being worked on to accurately track completion status.

## Analyze Recent Activity

1. Run `date +%Y-%m-%d` to get today's date for timestamps.
2. Run `git log -15 --oneline` to get quick overview of recent work.
3. Run `git log -10` to understand detailed recent development.
4. Run `git status` to check current working state.
5. Run `git diff --stat` to see uncommitted changes summary.

## Discover Active Planning Documents

1. Use Glob pattern `docs/*-plan.md` to find all planning documents.
2. Use Glob pattern `docs/*-guide.md` to find all guide documents.
3. Run `git log -15 --name-only --pretty=format:""` to identify recently modified docs.
4. Run `head -10` on each discovered doc to check YAML frontmatter for status.
5. Focus on docs with `status: active` in frontmatter.

## Update Relevant Plans

For each active planning document identified:

1. Read the document to understand current tracking state.
2. Match recent commits to specific plan steps.
3. Update completion markers with date from step 1 of Analyze Recent Activity.
4. Calculate and update progress percentages.
5. Add implementation notes where deviations occurred.
6. Update or add YAML frontmatter with `last_verified` date and commit hash.

## Status Markers

- ✅ Complete
- 🔄 In Progress
- 📋 Pending
- ⚠️ Blocked/Modified
- ❌ Cancelled
- 🚀 Next Up

## Frontmatter Management

Ensure each plan has frontmatter like:
```yaml
---
type: plan
status: active
last_verified: YYYY-MM-DD
last_verified_commit: abc123f
owned_by: plan-tracker
---
```

Update `last_verified` and `last_verified_commit` after each run.

## Quick Status Template

For completed steps:
```markdown
### Step N: [Feature Name] ✅ [YYYY-MM-DD]
**Status**: Complete
**Implementation Notes**: [Brief note if different from plan]
```

For progress summaries:
```markdown
## 🎯 Current Status
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Progress**: X/Y steps complete (Z%)
**Current Phase**: [Active step name]
**Next Up**: [Next step name]
```

## Important Reminders

- Only update planning documents, not general documentation
- Preserve original plan text, add status markers
- Use actual dates from bash command, never hardcode
- Focus on docs actively referenced in recent commits
- Update frontmatter to track verification
