# CLAUDE.md Context Curator

## Objective

Keep CLAUDE.md accurately reflecting current project state while preserving core instructions and philosophy.

## Analyze Current State

1. Run `date +%Y-%m-%d` to get today's date.
2. Run `git log -15 --oneline` for recent activity overview.
3. Run `git log -5` for detailed recent commits.
4. Run `git log -1 --format=%H` to get latest commit hash.

## Discover Current Focus

1. Use Glob pattern `docs/*-plan.md` to find planning documents.
2. Use Glob pattern `docs/*-guide.md` to find guide documents.
3. Run `head -10` on each to check YAML frontmatter.
4. Identify docs with `status: active` as current focus.
5. Read CLAUDE.md to understand current documented state.

## Sections to Maintain

CLAUDE.md contains managed sections marked with XML-style tags:

```xml
<project-status>
Current Phase: [phase name]
Active Plan: docs/[current-plan].md
Next Priority: [next major task]
Last Verified: YYYY-MM-DD (commit-hash)
</project-status>
```

ONLY update content within these managed sections:
- `<project-status>...</project-status>` - Current development state
- `<active-files>...</active-files>` - Important file references
- `<next-steps>...</next-steps>` - Immediate priorities

## Suggest-First Protocol

1. **Analyze** what needs updating based on git history.
2. **Propose** changes in a clear format:
   ```
   Proposed CLAUDE.md Updates:

   1. Update project-status section:
      - Change "Active Plan" from X to Y
      - Update "Current Phase" to match new plan

   2. Update active-files section:
      - Add reference to new-feature.md
      - Mark old-plan.md as archived

   [Show diffs of proposed changes]
   ```
3. **Wait** for approval before applying changes.
4. **Apply** only approved changes using Edit tool.

## What NOT to Touch

Never modify these sections:
- Project philosophy and goals
- Collaboration principles
- Developer context (name, ADHD notes)
- Core workflow instructions
- Testing checklists
- Common commands

## Change Triggers

Update CLAUDE.md when:
- New plan becomes active (detected via git commits)
- Major phase completes (detected in plan-tracker updates)
- Project pivots (PIVOT: in commit message)
- Files referenced no longer exist
- New critical docs appear

## Validation Checks

Before proposing changes:
1. Verify referenced files exist with Glob.
2. Confirm new active plan has `status: active` in frontmatter.
3. Check that current phase matches plan content.
4. Ensure dates use today's date from bash command.

## Important Notes

- This is a living document loaded at session start
- Keep managed sections concise and factual
- Preserve the educational and collaborative tone
- Updates should help orient new sessions quickly
- Always work in suggest-first mode for safety
