# Session Resume: Context Recovery After Compaction

## What We're Resuming

$ARGUMENTS

ultrathink

## üß† Deep Context Analysis

Analyze the compression summary above. You've been auto-compacted, which means you've lost detailed context. Your task is to:

1. **Identify what specific context might be missing** from the summary
2. **Determine which files contain critical implementation details** not captured in summary
3. **Understand what work was in progress** before compaction

## üìä Current Git State

!`git status`

## üìù Uncommitted Changes (if any)

!`git diff --stat`

## üîç Recent Work Context

!`git log -5`

## üéØ Strategic Context Recovery

Based on the summary and git state, now selectively read ONLY the files that will help you recover missing context:

### Core Context Files

@CLAUDE.md
@docs/night-scene-makeover-guide.md

### Implementation State Discovery

!`find src -name "*.js" -exec grep -l "TODO\|FIXME\|XXX" {} \;`
!`ls -la src/`

## üîÑ Work Continuation Strategy

After analyzing the above:

1. **Identify exactly where work was interrupted**
2. **Read the specific implementation files** that were being modified
3. **Check for any incomplete TODOs** in the codebase
4. **Reconstruct your todo list** based on discovered context
5. **Verify understanding** by summarizing:
   - What was completed
   - What was in progress
   - What comes next per the guides

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Questions to Answer

Before continuing work, explicitly answer:

- What feature/step was being implemented?
- Which files were being modified?
- What testing was completed?
- What was the next immediate task?

## Expected Response

Provide:

1. **Recovered Context Summary** - What you've determined from the analysis
2. **Missing Context Identified** - What the compression likely lost
3. **Files to Deep Read** - Specific files you need to examine in detail
4. **Reconstructed TODO List** - Based on discovered state
5. **Continuation Plan** - Exactly where to resume work
